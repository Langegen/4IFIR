## Composition of 4IFIR

1. **[4efirosphere](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR?path=%2FMariko)**, fork [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere), revealing the overclocking potential of the console
1. **[Sigpatches](https://jits.cc/patches)**, revealing the gaming potential of the console
1. **[4ekate](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR)**, fork [hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate), revealing the overclocking potential of the console memory
1. **Installed payloads**:

   * [DBI](https://github.com/rashevskyv/dbi) - potentially the best file manager, save manager and console program installer
   * [Fizeau](https://github.com/averne/Fizeau) - a program that allows you to change the parameters of displaying colors on the screen
   * [SysDVR](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [SysDVR](https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR) - a program for wirelessly transmitting images from the console to a PC or other devices

   * [Mhz] – a program for testing the processor
   * [MicroMemBench] – a program showing the results of memory performance
   * [MicroMemTest] – memory stress test
   * [RaytracingNX] -  testing the GPU. 

1. **Installed modules**. Modules are additional components that work inside Atmosphere and allow you to do different cool things, such as using Xbox-compatible controllers, amiibo emulation, overclocking, etc.
   * [SaltyNX](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [SaltyNX](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX), a background module that allows you to modify files\processes in the console, supports plugins. Not compatible with 32-bit games (list on the project's github). Required for some other modules to work (e.g. ReverseNX)
   * [ReverseNX-Tool](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [ReverseNX-Tool](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-Tool) - a program that forcibly changes the console modes to dock and handheld, regardless of whether the console is in the dock or not. Potentially improves the picture in the handheld due to the fact that it renders the image as if the console is in the dock. 
   * [sys-clk](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [sys-clk](https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk), module responsible for overclocking the processor, memory, GPU, which leads to better performance
   * [sys-con](https://github.com/cathery/sys-con) - module that allows you to connect almost any gamepad to the console via USB
   * [Uberhand Overlay Menu](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [Uberhand Overlay Menu](https://github.com/efosamark/Uberhand-Overlay) - special overlay menu for interacting with the system: overclocking, managing modes via ReverseNX, enabling cheats, etc. 
     - [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) - overlay that allows you to block FPS in games 
     - [nx-ovlloader](https://github.com/WerWolv/nx-ovlloader/) - this module is used to switch installed modules via Uberhand 
     - [ovlEdiZon](https://github.com/proferabg/EdiZon-Overlay/releases) - overlay for using cheats
     - [ovlSysmodules](https://github.com/WerWolv/ovl-sysmodules/) - overlay for enabling and disabling installed system modules
     - [InfoNX-ovl](https://github.com/renA21/InfoNX/) - overlay that shows information about the battery/CPU/GPU/DRAM(EMC)
     - [QuickNTP](https://github.com/nedex/QuickNTP) - overlay for synchronizing clocks via the Internet, since the native one is disabled in 4ifir 
     - [Status-Monitor-PRO](https://cloud.sintez.io/s/4IFIR), fork [Status-Monitor-Overlay](https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay) - module for monitoring console parameters in real time. Can act as an FPS counter in the upper left corner of the screen
     - [sys-ftpd-ovl](https://github.com/SegFault42/sys-ftpd-ovl) - overlay for working with sys-ftpd via Uberhand 
     - [sysdvr-overlay](https://github.com/Hartie95/sysdvr-overlay), fork [sysdvr-overlay](https://github.com/Hartie95/sysdvr-overlay) - overlay for configuring SysDVR via Uberhand 
     - [sys-clk overlay](https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk) - overlay for overclocking control via Uberhand 
     - [Fizeau overlay](https://github.com/averne/Fizeau)  - overlay for configuring Fizeau via Uberhand
